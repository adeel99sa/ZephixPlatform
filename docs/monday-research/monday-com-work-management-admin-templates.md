## Work Management Platform

### Overview

**Monday.com Work Management** is the core product built on the Monday.com Work OS. It's designed for general task and project planning for teams across all functions. Unlike specialized products (CRM, Dev, Service), Work Management provides flexible, customizable workflows that can adapt to any business need.

### Core Components

#### 1. Boards

**What are Boards?**
- The foundation of the Work Management platform
- Workspace-specific containers for tracking projects, workflows, or collections of tasks
- Can represent: Projects, Departments, Products, Processes, or any work structure

**Board Capabilities:**
- Create items (tasks) and subitems for detailed breakdowns
- Use 30+ column types to structure data (Status, People, Date, Timeline, Formula, Dropdown, Location, etc.)
- Connect items across different boards using Connect Boards / Mirror columns
- Pull data from one board to another for cross-project visibility
- Organize items into groups (color-coded sections)

**Board Types:**
- **Main Boards**: Visible to all members of the account
- **Shareable Boards**: For external guests + internal members, only those invited
- **Private Boards**: Only visible to invited internal users (Pro/Enterprise plans)

2. **Regular Audits**: 
   - Regularly audit board/workspace ownerships
   - Especially when people leave the company
   - Review permissions periodically

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: 
   - Only grant permissions required for someone's role
   - If someone only needs billing access, create a sub-admin with only that privilege

4. **Understand Workspace Privacy**: 
   - Open vs closed workspace visibility matters for security
   - Choose appropriate privacy settings

5. **Transfer Ownership Before Deactivation**: 
   - Transfer automations, integrations, board ownerships before deactivating a user
   - Otherwise, functions may break or items may become inaccessible

6. **Monitor Usage**: 
   - Regularly check usage statistics
   - Optimize costs
   - Ensure compliance with plan limits

7. **Security First**: 
   - Enable 2FA for all users
   - Set up domain claiming
