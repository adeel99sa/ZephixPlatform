MVP SCOPE - LOCKED

One-sentence MVP
Admin creates a workspace, creates a project from a template, assigns tasks to members, members update status and comment, admin sees rollups and one basic reporting surface, with role-gated access.

MVP Flow Steps
1. Login
2. Land on role home
3. Enter workspace by slug
4. Create project from template
5. Assign work and update status
6. Verify rollups and basic reporting

Each sprint requires runtime proof artifacts demonstrating working functionality.
No Phase6 features or overview page builder work included in MVP scope.
