MVP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - LOCKED

Sprint Breakdown

Sprint 1: Auth (S1)

Deliverables:
- Workspace creation endpoint with preview
- Workspace slug resolution endpoint
- Workspace home route /w/:slug/home
- WorkspaceHome component with health snapshot widget
- Health snapshot endpoint with execution summary
- Overdue tasks panel
- Recent activity panel
Proof Gate: Gate 2 - Governance Preview and Apply

Sprint 3: Templates (S3)
Duration: Week 2, Days 1-3
Goal: Template Center and template instantiation to project
Deliverables:
- Template Center UI at /templates
- Template list endpoint
- Template preview modal
- Template instantiation endpoint
- Project creation with phases and tasks from template
- Success navigation to project overview
Proof Gate: Gate 3 - Template Instantiation

Sprint 4: Resources (S4)
Duration: Week 2, Days 4-5
Goal: Resource allocation tracking and utilization reporting
Deliverables:
- Resource allocation calculation endpoints
- Allocation percentage validation
- Over-allocation warning system
- Resource utilization reporting endpoints
- Utilization metrics display
Proof Gate: Gate 4 - Resources Utilization

Sprint 5: Security (S5)
Duration: Week 2, Days 6-7
Goal: Workspace-scoped access control and negative test coverage
Deliverables:
- Workspace-scoped query enforcement
- Cross-workspace access blocking (403/404 responses)
- Role-based permission enforcement
- Negative test suite for security
- Security proof artifacts
Proof Gate: Gate 5 - Security Negative Tests

Execution Sequence

Week 1:
Day 1-2: Sprint 1 (Auth) - Cookie flow, role homes
Day 3-5: Sprint 2 (Governance) - Workspace creation, workspace home, health snapshot

Week 2:
Day 1-3: Sprint 3 (Templates) - Template Center, instantiation
Day 4-5: Sprint 4 (Resources) - Allocation calculations, utilization
Day 6-7: Sprint 5 (Security) - Access control, negative tests

Acceptance Criteria by Sprint

Sprint 1: Auth
- Login returns HTTP 200 with Set-Cookie header
- Refresh token stored securely
- AdminHome displays organization aggregations
- MemberHome displays assigned work aggregations
- GuestHome displays read-only access
- Role-based routing works at /home

Sprint 2: Governance
- Workspace preview shows validation
- Workspace creation returns workspaceId
- Workspace home loads at /w/:slug/home
- Health snapshot displays execution summary
- Overdue tasks panel shows top 10 items
- Recent activity panel shows last 20 activities

Sprint 3: Templates
- Template Center lists available templates
- Template preview shows phases and tasks
- Template instantiation creates project
- Project contains phases and tasks from template
- Success navigation routes to project overview

Sprint 4: Resources
- Allocation percentages calculated correctly
- Over-allocation warnings displayed
- Utilization metrics accurate
- Resource endpoints return correct data

Sprint 5: Security
- Cross-workspace access blocked (403/404)
- Role-based permissions enforced
- No data leakage across workspaces
- Negative tests pass

Dependencies

Sprint 1 (Auth) -> Sprint 2 (Governance): Role-based routing needed for workspace access
Sprint 2 (Governance) -> Sprint 3 (Templates): Workspace context needed for project creation
Sprint 3 (Templates) -> Sprint 4 (Resources): Projects needed for resource allocation
Sprint 4 (Resources) -> Sprint 5 (Security): Resource access needs security enforcement

All sprints must pass their proof gates before MVP is considered complete.
