MVP PROOF GATES - LOCKED

Gate 1: Auth Cookie Flow
Sprint: S1 Auth
Proof Required: Runtime proof of cookie-based authentication
Artifact: proofs/runtime/curl/auth_cookie_flow.sh must execute successfully
Acceptance: Login returns HTTP 200 with Set-Cookie header, refresh token stored, session maintained

Gate 2: Governance Preview and Apply
Sprint: S2 Governance
Proof Required: Runtime proof of workspace creation and preview
Artifacts: 
  - proofs/runtime/curl/governance_preview.sh must execute successfully
  - proofs/runtime/curl/governance_apply.sh must execute successfully
Acceptance: Workspace preview shows validation, workspace creation returns workspaceId, workspace home loads at /w/:slug/home

Gate 3: Template Instantiation
Sprint: S3 Templates
Proof Required: Runtime proof of template to project creation
Artifact: proofs/runtime/curl/templates_instantiate.sh must execute successfully
Acceptance: Template selection works, template instantiation creates project with phases and tasks, projectId returned

Gate 4: Resources Utilization
Sprint: S4 Resources
Proof Required: Runtime proof of resource allocation calculations
Artifact: proofs/runtime/curl/resources_utilization.sh must execute successfully
Acceptance: Allocation percentages calculated correctly, over-allocation warnings displayed, utilization metrics accurate

Gate 5: Security Negative Tests
Sprint: S5 Security
Proof Required: Runtime proof of cross-workspace access blocking
Artifact: proofs/runtime/curl/security_negative.sh must execute successfully
Acceptance: Cross-workspace access attempts return 403 or 404, role-based permissions enforced, no data leakage

Proof Gate Execution

All gates must pass before MVP is considered complete.
Each gate requires executable curl script that demonstrates working functionality.
Scripts must be runnable against local, staging, or production environments.
Proof artifacts must be committed to proofs/runtime/ directory.
