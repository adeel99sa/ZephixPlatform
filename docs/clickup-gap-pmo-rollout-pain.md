# ClickUp Gap: PMO & Delivery Lead Rollout Pain

## Where Customers Lose Trust

**Answer:** Customers lose trust when rollout reveals the system doesn't work at PMO scale, requiring extensive workarounds, manual processes, and constant firefighting.

## The Failure Points

### 1. Resource Planning Doesn't Scale

**Problem:**
- Can't set capacity for individual days (vacations, irregular schedules)
- Customizable per-day capacity only on higher tier plans
- No automatic matching of tasks to available capacity
- Manual assignment required despite "resource planning" features

**Customer Impact:**
- PMO can't plan at scale
- Delivery leads spend time on manual allocation
- Teams over-committed without visibility
- Burnout and missed deadlines

**Where Trust Breaks:**
- PMO loses confidence in planning capability
- Delivery leads abandon resource planning features
- Executives question tool value
- Teams don't trust capacity numbers

### 2. Governance & Standardization Failures

**Problem:**
- Without consistent naming, status workflows, task structuring, aggregated reporting becomes unreliable
- Custom fields, task hierarchies inconsistent
- No enforcement of standards
- Manual governance required

**Customer Impact:**
- Can't roll up metrics reliably
- Inconsistent data structures
- Manual reconciliation
- Governance impossible

**Where Trust Breaks:**
- PMO can't produce reliable reports
- Delivery leads can't compare projects
- Executives get inconsistent data
- System becomes untrustworthy

### 3. Performance Degradation

**Problem:**
- Large workspaces cause sluggish loading
- Slow filter operations in critical views
- Dashboard complexity degrades performance
- System becomes unusable at scale

**Customer Impact:**
- Can't use system for real-time planning
- Delays in critical workflows
- Teams abandon features
- Workarounds required

**Where Trust Breaks:**
- PMO can't get timely reports
- Delivery leads can't use system effectively
- Teams lose confidence
- Adoption fails

### 4. Integration & Visibility Gaps

**Problem:**
- Meeting calendars, external commitments don't auto-sync into Workload view
- Real availability overstated
- Need external tools for holistic visibility
- Custom dashboards required

**Customer Impact:**
- Incomplete resource picture
- Manual data entry
- Multiple tools required
- Increased complexity

**Where Trust Breaks:**
- PMO can't get complete picture
- Delivery leads lose confidence in data
- Teams don't trust availability
- System becomes part of problem

### 5. Change Management Overload

**Problem:**
- Policy decisions require extensive documentation, communication, training
- Administrators must map out roles, permissions, defaults
- System "defaults" to full edit or public cause misunderstandings
- Change management becomes full-time job

**Customer Impact:**
- Rollout delays
- Training burden
- Confusion and errors
- Adoption resistance

**Where Trust Breaks:**
- PMO can't scale rollout
- Delivery leads overwhelmed
- Teams resist adoption
- Enterprise deployment fails

## What Zephix Must Do Differently

**Enforce Operating Model:**
- One hierarchy (Org → Workspace → Project → Plan)
- No alternative structures
- Templates define structure
- Users execute inside it

**Make Resources Unavoidable:**
- Cannot plan without capacity
- Cannot assign without checking availability
- Cannot commit work without consuming capacity
- Over-allocation blocks by default

**Templates Deploy Systems:**
- Templates include work type, required fields, capacity assumptions, KPI pack, dashboards, permissions, RACI
- Instantiation produces runnable, measurable, governable project
- No manual setup required

**Reduce Cognitive Load:**
- Fewer decisions, stronger guarantees
- Default beats choice
- Hide configuration that doesn't change decisions
- Templates handle most configuration

**Performance at Scale:**
- System works at PMO scale
- No performance degradation
- Real-time planning capability
- Reliable reporting
