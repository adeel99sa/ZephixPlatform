## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /workspace/zephix-frontend
chmod +x scripts/setup-test-env.sh
./scripts/setup-test-env.sh
```

### Manual Database Reset
```bash
cd /workspace/zephix-frontend
npm run test:reset-db
```

### Using Test Data in Cypress
```javascript
// Load user data
cy.fixture('test-users.json').then((users) => {
  const pmUser = users.users[0];
  cy.login(pmUser.email, pmUser.password);
});

// Load project data
cy.fixture('projects-test-data.json').then((data) => {
  const bankingProjects = data.projects.banking;
  // Use in tests
});

// Load integration data
cy.fixture('integrations-mock.json').then((integrations) => {
  // Mock API responses
});
```

## Test Coverage Enabled

With this infrastructure, the following test scenarios are now fully supported:

1. **Multi-role Testing**: Test with 8 different user personas
2. **Industry-specific Workflows**: Banking, Manufacturing, Real Estate scenarios
3. **Integration Testing**: 8 different integration states and configurations
4. **BRD Processing**: Realistic document structures for AI testing
5. **Dashboard Metrics**: Complete data for all dashboard visualizations
6. **Risk Management**: Various risk severities and mitigation strategies
7. **Budget Tracking**: Projects with different budget utilization levels
8. **Timeline Testing**: Projects in different phases and completion states

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test suite**: `npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/pm-dashboard-comprehensive.cy.ts"`
2. **Implement data-testid attributes** in React components
3. **Configure CI/CD** to use test database
