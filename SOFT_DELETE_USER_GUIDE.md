# Soft Delete User Guide

## What is Soft Delete?

Soft delete is a safety feature that prevents accidental data loss. When you "delete" a project or task, it's not immediately removed from the system. Instead, it's moved to a trash area where it can be recovered.

## For Regular Users

### Deleting Projects and Tasks

1. **Delete a Project:**
   - Go to the Projects page
   - Click the "Delete" button on any project
   - Confirm the deletion in the popup

2. **Delete a Task:**
   - Go to any project's task list
   - Click the "Delete" button on any task
   - Confirm the deletion in the popup

### Undo Feature

After deleting a project or task, you'll see an **undo banner** at the top of the page:

- ‚è∞ **10-second countdown** - You have 10 seconds to undo
- üîÑ **Undo button** - Click to restore the item immediately
- ‚ùå **Dismiss button** - Click to close the banner

**Important:** After 10 seconds, the undo banner disappears and you'll need admin help to restore the item.

## For Administrators

### Accessing the Trash

1. **Navigate to Trash:**
   - Go to the Admin section
   - Click on "Trash" in the sidebar
