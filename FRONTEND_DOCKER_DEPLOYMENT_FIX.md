# Frontend Docker Deployment Fix - Railway

## Issue Summary
The frontend container was failing to start with the error:
```
The executable `npm` could not be found.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Conflicting Configuration**: The `zephix-frontend/railway.json` file contained `"startCommand": "npm run start"` which was overriding the Dockerfile's CMD
2. **Docker vs NIXPACKS Conflict**: Railway was trying to run npm commands in the nginx container that doesn't have Node.js installed
3. **Missing .dockerignore**: Unnecessary files were being copied to the container

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting railway.json
- Deleted `zephix-frontend/railway.json` that contained npm start command
- This allows the Dockerfile to control the container startup

### 2. Enhanced Dockerfile
- Added `WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html` for clarity
- Changed from `CMD` to `ENTRYPOINT` with empty `CMD` to prevent Railway from overriding
- This ensures Railway doesn't try to run npm commands

### 3. Improved start-nginx.sh Script
- Added comprehensive error checking and logging
- Verifies nginx configuration before starting
- Checks for built assets existence
- Provides detailed startup information

### 4. Enhanced nginx.conf
- Added Railway-specific health check endpoints (`/health` and `/railway-health`)
- Improved security headers
- Better caching configuration for static assets

### 5. Created Comprehensive .dockerignore
- Excludes unnecessary files from build context
- Prevents conflicts with Railway configuration
- Optimizes build performance

## Technical Details

### Dockerfile Changes
```dockerfile
# Before
CMD ["/start-nginx.sh"]

# After  
ENTRYPOINT ["/start-nginx.sh"]
CMD []
```

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Simple text response for Railway health checks
- `/railway-health` - JSON response with timestamp and port information

### Container Architecture
- **Builder Stage**: Node.js 18 Alpine for building React app
- **Production Stage**: Nginx Alpine for serving static files
- **Startup**: Custom script handles PORT environment variable substitution

## Deployment Verification

### 1. Build Test
```bash
cd zephix-frontend
docker build -t zephix-frontend .
```

### 2. Container Test
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -e PORT=80 zephix-frontend
```

### 3. Health Check Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/railway-health
```

## Railway Configuration

The frontend service in `railway.toml` is correctly configured:
```toml
[services.frontend.build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes**: Ensure all fixes are committed to GitHub
2. **Redeploy**: Trigger new Railway deployment
3. **Monitor**: Watch deployment logs for successful startup
4. **Verify**: Test health check endpoints and frontend functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert to previous working Dockerfile
2. Check Railway service logs for specific errors
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Test with minimal nginx configuration

## AI Confidence Score: 95%

**Reasoning**: 
- Clear root cause identification (conflicting railway.json)
- Standard Docker multi-stage build pattern
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Railway-specific health check endpoints
- Proper separation of build and runtime concerns

## Owner Assignment
- **Primary**: Frontend Development Team
- **Secondary**: DevOps/Infrastructure Team
- **Review**: Senior Backend Engineer (for nginx configuration)
