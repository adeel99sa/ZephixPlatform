# Gitleaks ignore file - only for vetted false positives
# NEVER use this to mask real credentials

# Example false positives (uncomment if needed):
# ^.*test.*password.*$
# ^.*example.*key.*$
# ^.*demo.*token.*$

# Note: This file should remain mostly empty
# Real secrets should be rotated, not ignored
