# Railway Frontend Deployment Fix

## Problem Summary
Your Zephix Frontend was deploying successfully on Railway but showing "Application failed to respond" because of a **port configuration mismatch**.

## Root Cause
- **nginx was hardcoded to port 80**
- **Railway expects services to listen on the PORT environment variable**
- **Container started successfully but couldn't respond on Railway's expected port**

## Files Modified

### 1. `nginx.conf`
- Changed `listen 80;` to `listen ${PORT:-80} default_server;`
- Added `default_server` directive for proper binding

### 2. `start-nginx.sh` (NEW)
- Startup script that handles PORT environment variable
- Uses `envsubst` to substitute PORT value into nginx config
- Provides fallback to port 80 if PORT is not set

### 3. `Dockerfile`
- Added `bash` package for environment variable substitution
- Copies and makes startup script executable
- Changed CMD to use startup script instead of direct nginx

## How the Fix Works

1. **Railway sets PORT environment variable** (e.g., PORT=3000)
2. **start-nginx.sh runs** and substitutes PORT value into nginx.conf
3. **nginx starts** listening on the correct port (e.g., 3000)
4. **Railway can now communicate** with your service

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd zephix-frontend
git add .
git commit -m 'fix: configure nginx for Railway PORT environment variable'
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Auto-Redeploy
- Railway will automatically detect the push
- New container will be built with the fixes
- Service should become responsive

### 3. Verify Deployment
Check Railway logs for:
```
Starting nginx on port 3000  # or whatever port Railway assigns
```

### 4. Test Endpoints
- **Health Check**: `https://your-domain.railway.app/health`
- **Main Site**: `https://your-domain.railway.app`

## Expected Results

✅ **Before Fix**: Container starts, nginx runs on port 80, Railway can't connect
✅ **After Fix**: Container starts, nginx runs on Railway's PORT, service responds

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Working
1. **Check Railway logs** for startup messages
2. **Verify PORT environment variable** in Railway dashboard
3. **Test health endpoint** to confirm nginx is responding
4. **Check if domain is properly configured** in Railway

### Common Issues
- **Wrong PORT value**: Check Railway environment variables
- **nginx not starting**: Check startup script permissions
- **Domain not working**: Verify Railway domain configuration

## Security Notes
- Health endpoint is public (intentional for Railway health checks)
- All security headers are properly configured
- CSP is set to allow necessary resources
- No secrets are exposed in configuration

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can quickly rollback:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Files Changed Summary
```
✅ nginx.conf - Updated port configuration
✅ start-nginx.sh - New startup script
✅ Dockerfile - Updated to use startup script
✅ scripts/deploy-verify.sh - New verification script
```

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Monitor Railway logs for successful startup
2. Test all major application routes
3. Verify performance and response times
4. Update monitoring/alerting if needed

**Fix implemented**: August 10, 2024  
**Expected resolution time**: 5-10 minutes after push  
**Risk level**: Low (configuration change only)
