        question: "How does Zephix detect resource conflicts?",
        answer: "Our AI analyzes patterns across your entire project portfolio, including team availability, skill requirements, and project dependencies. It learns from historical data to predict where conflicts will occur before they impact delivery."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm already using Monday, Asana, or Jira?",
        answer: "Perfect! Zephix integrates with your existing tools. We don't replace them - we add intelligence layer that reveals insights they can't see. You keep your current workflow, we add the missing intelligence."
      },
      {
        question: "How accurate are the predictions?",
        answer: "Our AI starts at 55-65% accuracy and improves to 80%+ within 30 days as it learns your team's patterns. We're transparent about accuracy and continuously improve our models."
      },
      {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We're SOC2 compliant with enterprise-grade security. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with strict access controls and regular security audits."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the setup process like?",
        answer: "Setup takes under 5 minutes. Connect your existing PM tools, and our AI starts learning immediately. No data migration or workflow changes required."
