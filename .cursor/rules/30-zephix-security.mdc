Tenancy
- organizationId is mandatory for data access.
- MEMBER and VIEWER responses must be filtered to accessibleWorkspaceIds for any cross workspace aggregate.

Auth
- Use platformRole as source of truth.
- Refresh and sessions stay server tracked. No stateless refresh fallback.

Auditing
- Prefer structured exceptions. No throwing raw Error for request validation.
