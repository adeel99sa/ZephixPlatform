Frontend standards
- Role gating uses helpers and constants. No raw string role comparisons.
- VIEWER is Guest. Paid routes are ADMIN and MEMBER only.
- Keep routing stable. Use existing layouts and guards.

UX rules
- Do not clone competitors.
- Keep profile actions role aware and minimal.
- Keep navigation consistent with workspace slug routing: /w/:slug/home.
