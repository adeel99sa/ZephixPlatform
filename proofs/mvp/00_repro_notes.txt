# Bug Reproduction Notes

## Workspace Create Bug
**Status:** Fixed
**Issue:** UI was sending `ownerId` in request body
**Fix:** Removed `ownerId` from WorkspaceCreateModal, backend derives from auth context
**Error Message:** Was showing "Query parameter 'ownerId' is not allowed" (misleading - was in body)
**Fix Applied:** Error message now says "property 'ownerId' should not exist"

## /home Failed to Load Bug
**Status:** Fixed
**Issue:** Home page showed "Failed to load home data" without retry option
**Root Cause:** Error handling didn't provide retry, and no empty state when no workspace selected
**Fix Applied:**
- Added empty state when `activeWorkspaceId` is null
- Empty state shows "Select Workspace" and "Create Project" buttons
- Error state now shows retry button
- Uses toast for error messages instead of console.error only
