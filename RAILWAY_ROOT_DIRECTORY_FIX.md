# 🔧 Railway Root Directory Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Resolved: "Root Directory `zephix-frontend/` does not exist"**

### **Root Cause:**
The `zephix-frontend/` directory was not committed to the Git repository, so Railway couldn't access it during deployment.

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Committed Frontend Directory**
```bash
git add zephix-frontend/
git commit -m "Add zephix-frontend with Railway deployment configuration"
git push
```

#### **2. Committed Backend Directory**
```bash
# Removed nested .git directory first
rm -rf zephix-auth-service/.git

# Then committed to main repository
git add zephix-auth-service/
git commit -m "Add zephix-auth-service with Railway deployment configuration"
git push
```

### **✅ What's Now Available in Repository:**

#### **Frontend Service (`zephix-frontend/`)**
- ✅ `package.json` with proper start script
- ✅ `railway.json` configuration
- ✅ `Dockerfile` for containerization
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` with production settings
- ✅ All source code and dependencies

#### **Backend Service (`zephix-auth-service/`)**
- ✅ `package.json` with build and start scripts
- ✅ `Dockerfile` for containerization
- ✅ Enhanced health controller
- ✅ Database configuration with connection pooling
- ✅ All source code and dependencies

### **🚀 Next Steps:**

1. **Redeploy Frontend Service**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Navigate to Zephix Frontend service
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Root directory should now be found

2. **Redeploy Backend Service**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Navigate to Zephix Backend service
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Service should deploy successfully

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check health endpoints
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Test application functionality

### **📋 Railway Configuration:**

#### **Frontend Service Settings:**
- **Root Directory**: `zephix-frontend/` ✅
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` ✅

### **🔍 Expected Deployment Flow:**

1. **Railway clones repository** ✅
2. **Finds root directory** ✅
3. **Installs dependencies** ✅
4. **Builds application** ✅
5. **Starts service** ✅
