## Usage Examples

### 1. Perform Risk Analysis

```typescript
const riskAnalysisInput = {
  projectId: "project-uuid",
  riskSources: {
    projectData: true,
    externalFactors: true,
    stakeholderFeedback: true,
    historicalData: true,
    industryTrends: true,
    marketConditions: true
  },
  scanDepth: "comprehensive",
  focusAreas: ["technical", "schedule", "budget"]
};

const analysis = await riskManagementService.performRiskAnalysis(
  riskAnalysisInput,
  userId
);
```

### 2. Get Risk Register

```typescript
const riskRegister = await riskManagementService.getRiskRegister(projectId);
```

### 3. Update Risk Status

```typescript
const updatedRisk = await riskManagementService.updateRiskStatus(
  riskId,
  "mitigated",
  "Risk has been successfully mitigated through additional testing",
  userId
);
```

## Database Schema

### Risks Table
- Comprehensive risk metadata
- JSONB fields for complex data structures
- Indexed for performance on project and risk level queries

### Risk Assessments Table
