# Quick Email Fix - Implementation Steps

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in with your Gmail account
3. Select app: "Mail"
4. Select device: "Other" ‚Üí Name it "Zephix"
5. Click "Generate"
6. **COPY THE 16-CHARACTER PASSWORD**

### Step 2: Update .env File (2 minutes)
Edit `/workspace/zephix-backend/.env`:

```env
# Replace these values with your actual credentials
SMTP_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com          # Your Gmail address
SMTP_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop           # The 16-character app password (no spaces)
```

### Step 3: Test Configuration (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /workspace/zephix-backend
npm run test:email your-email@example.com
```

### Step 4: Restart Backend Service
```bash
# If running locally
npm run start:dev

# If deployed on Railway
git add .env
git commit -m "Add email configuration"
git push
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Security**: The .env file should already be in .gitignore. Never commit credentials!
2. **Spam Folder**: Emails may go to spam because FROM address (noreply@getzephix.com) doesn't match Gmail domain
3. **Rate Limits**: Gmail allows ~500 emails/day for personal accounts
4. **Production**: For production deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting platform (Railway, etc.)
