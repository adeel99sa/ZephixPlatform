# Zephix Module Migration Plan

## Phase 0: Assessment (Current)
- [ ] Verify new modules have all required functionality
- [ ] List all missing guards/decorators/entities
- [ ] Create missing components in new modules

## Phase 1: Parallel Running (Safe)
- [ ] Keep both module structures
- [ ] Copy missing functionality to new modules
- [ ] Test new modules work independently

## Phase 2: Gradual Switch
- [ ] Update one controller at a time to use new imports
- [ ] Test after each controller update
- [ ] Keep old modules as backup

## Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify database operations

## Phase 4: Cleanup (Only after full verification)
- [ ] Remove old modules
- [ ] Clean up imports
- [ ] Remove duplicates

## Rollback Plan
- Git commit before each phase
- Database backup before changes
- Keep old modules in separate branch
