# EMERGENCY RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS:
# If database connection fails and application won't start:
# 1. Set SKIP_DATABASE = "true" in Railway environment variables
# 2. Set EMERGENCY_MODE = "true" in Railway environment variables
# 3. Redeploy the application
# 4. This will allow basic health checks and API structure to work
# 5. Fix database connection issues
# 6. Set SKIP_DATABASE back to "false" and redeploy

# CRITICAL RAILWAY ROUTING FIXES:
# 1. Health check path corrected to "/api/health"
# 2. Port explicitly set to 3000
# 3. Railway static URL configured
# 4. Health check timeouts optimized for Railway
# 5. Networking configuration added for proper routing
