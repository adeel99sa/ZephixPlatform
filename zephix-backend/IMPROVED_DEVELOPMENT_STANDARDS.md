# Zephix Development Standards - Post-Review Update

## CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### Never ship incomplete implementations:
- No mock data in service methods
- No placeholder business logic
- No hardcoded responses
- Always implement real algorithms

### Security-first from line 1:
- Organization scoping in all database queries
- Input validation with comprehensive DTOs
- File upload security (type, size, virus scanning)
- Proper authentication on all endpoints

### Complete service architecture:
- Controllers delegate to services
- Business logic in service layer
- Proper dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Production-ready patterns:
- Real external API integration (OpenAI, etc.)
- Background job processing for long operations
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Proper configuration management
- Database transactions for complex operations

## ENTERPRISE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW

### Service Implementation Template:
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ExampleService {
  constructor(
    private readonly repository: ExampleRepository,
    private readonly externalService: ExternalService,
    private readonly configService: ConfigService,
    private readonly auditService: AuditService,
  ) {}

  async performOperation(input: InputDto, context: SecurityContext): Promise<OutputDto> {
    try {
      // Validate business rules
      await this.validateBusinessRules(input, context);
      
      // Perform operation with proper error handling
      const result = await this.executeBusinessLogic(input);
      
      // Audit log the operation
      await this.auditService.logOperation('operation_name', context, result);
      
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.auditService.logError('operation_failed', error, context);
      throw this.handleError(error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates Checklist:
Before submitting any implementation:
- [ ] No mock data or hardcoded responses
- [ ] Complete service layer with real business logic
- [ ] Organization scoping enforced
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] External service integration with error handling
- [ ] Background processing for long operations
- [ ] Audit logging for compliance
- [ ] Database optimization with proper indexes
- [ ] Security validation (file uploads, etc.)

## DEPENDENCY INJECTION STANDARDS

### Module Organization:
- Always export services from their home module
- Import required modules explicitly
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use SharedModule for cross-cutting concerns

### Service Dependencies:
- Validate all constructor dependencies exist
- Check module imports before adding new services
- Use proper typing for all injected services
- Test dependency injection in development mode

## DEPLOYMENT READINESS CHECKLIST

### Before Railway Deployment:
- [ ] Backend builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All dependency injection errors resolved
- [ ] Health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All modules initialize successfully

### Post-Deployment Validation:
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend
- [ ] Authentication endpoints respond
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations function
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs
- [ ] Database queries execute

## LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS INCIDENT

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Missing Service Export**: VirusScanService existed but wasn't exported from SharedModule
2. **Incomplete Module Import**: AIModule didn't import SharedModule
3. **Dependency Chain Break**: AIMappingService couldn't resolve VirusScanService

### What We Fixed:
1. **Added VirusScanService to SharedModule exports**
2. **Imported SharedModule into AIModule**
3. **Verified all dependencies resolve correctly**

### Prevention Measures:
1. **Always test dependency injection in development**
2. **Validate module imports before adding new services**
3. **Use comprehensive testing for service dependencies**
4. **Check module exports when adding new services**

## NEXT PHASE PLANNING

### When System is Stable:
1. **Week 1**: Cherry-pick working components from enterprise features
2. **Week 2**: Reimplement AI features with improved quality standards
3. **Week 3**: Add workflow management with proper testing
4. **Week 4**: Complete enterprise features with full validation

### Quality Standards:
- Apply senior-level development patterns from day 1
- No rework cycles - get it right the first time
- Comprehensive testing before integration
- Security-first implementation approach

## SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED

✅ **Deployment Success**: Backend builds without errors
✅ **System Stability**: No dependency injection errors
✅ **Health Checks Pass**: All endpoints respond correctly
✅ **Preserved Value**: Enterprise features safely stored in feature branch
✅ **Improved Standards**: Clear development guidelines established
✅ **Foundation Ready**: System stable for continued development
