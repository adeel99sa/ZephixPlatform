# CORS X-Timestamp Header Fix

## Problem Description
The frontend was sending a custom `X-Timestamp` header with login requests, but the backend's CORS configuration didn't include this header in the `allowedHeaders` array. This caused CORS preflight requests to fail, preventing login requests from reaching the backend.

## Solution Applied
Added `X-Timestamp` to the `allowedHeaders` array in all CORS configurations across the codebase.

## Files Modified

### 1. Main Backend CORS Configuration
**File:** `zephix-backend/src/main.ts`
**Function:** `getCorsConfig()`

#### Production Environment
```typescript
allowedHeaders: [
  'Authorization',
  'Content-Type',
  'Accept',
  'Origin',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'X-Org-Id',
  'X-Request-Id',
  'X-CSRF-Token',
  'X-Forwarded-For',
  'X-Real-IP',
  'X-Timestamp', // ✅ ADDED
],
```

#### Local Development Environment
```typescript
allowedHeaders: [
  'Authorization',
  'Content-Type',
  'Accept',
  'Origin',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'X-Org-Id',
  'X-Request-Id',
  'X-Timestamp', // ✅ ADDED
],
```

#### Development with Vite Proxy
```typescript
allowedHeaders: [
  'Authorization',
  'Content-Type',
  'Accept',
  'Origin',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'X-Org-Id',
  'X-Request-Id',
  'X-Timestamp', // ✅ ADDED
],
```

### 2. Test Files Updated
**Files:**
- `zephix-backend/test/app.e2e-spec.ts`
- `zephix-backend/test/cors.e2e-spec.ts`
- `zephix-backend/test/architecture.e2e-spec.ts`

**Change:** Added `X-Timestamp` to `allowedHeaders` in test CORS configurations.

### 3. User Auth Service Package
**File:** `packages/user-auth-service/src/main.ts`

**Change:** Added `X-Timestamp` to the CORS configuration:
```typescript
allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Correlation-ID', 'X-MFA-Token', 'X-Timestamp']
```

## Security Considerations
- ✅ `X-Timestamp` header is now properly allowed in CORS preflight requests
- ✅ All environments (production, development, testing) are consistently configured
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced - header is only for request timing/logging
- ✅ Maintains existing security headers and CORS policies

## Deployment Requirements
**CRITICAL:** After making these changes, the backend must be redeployed to Railway for the CORS configuration to take effect.

### Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Deploy to Railway using the Railway MCP or CLI
3. Verify CORS headers are properly set in production

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Test CORS preflight with X-Timestamp header
curl -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://zephix-frontend-production.up.railway.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,X-Timestamp" \
  https://zephix-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login

# Expected response: 204 with proper CORS headers
```

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ Frontend login requests with `X-Timestamp` header will now pass CORS preflight
- ✅ Login functionality should work properly in production
- ✅ No more CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Maintains security and compliance with OWASP ASVS Level 1

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Local Testing:** Test with `npm run test:cors` to ensure CORS configuration works
2. **Production Testing:** Verify login flow works after deployment
3. **Header Validation:** Ensure `X-Timestamp` header is properly received by backend
4. **Security Testing:** Verify no security headers were compromised

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the `X-Timestamp` header can be removed from the `allowedHeaders` arrays in all modified files. This will restore the previous CORS configuration.
