# üöÄ Railway Deployment Configuration - Zephix Backend

## **DEPLOYMENT PATH ISSUE - RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

### **Problem Identified:**
Railway was looking for `/app/dist/src/main.js` but the actual build output is `/app/dist/main.js`

### **Root Cause:**
Path mismatch between Railway's expected file location and NestJS build output structure.

---

## **CONFIGURATION FILES - CORRECTED**

### **1. railway.json** ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "nixpacksConfigPath": "./nixpacks.toml"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node dist/main.js",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

### **2. nixpacks.toml** ‚úÖ
```toml
# CRITICAL FIX: Use explicit start command with correct path
[phases.start]
cmd = "node dist/main.js"

# CRITICAL FIX: Verify build output structure
[phases.build.nixpacksConfig]
cmds = [
  "npm run build",
  "ls -la dist/",
  "find dist/ -name 'main.js'",
  "npm prune --production"
]
```

### **3. package.json** ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:railway": "node dist/main.js",
    "verify:railway": "./scripts/verify-railway-build.sh"
  }
}
```

---

## **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### **Local Build Verification:**
```bash
# Clean build test
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build

# Verify file structure
find dist/ -name "main.js"
ls -la dist/

# Test start command locally
npm run start:railway

# Run Railway verification script
npm run verify:railway
```

### **Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Build verification successful:
   - dist/main.js exists ‚úì
   - Build output structure: [files listed]
üöÄ Railway deployment ready!
   - Start command: node dist/main.js
   - Build output: dist/main.js
   - All configurations verified ‚úì
```

## **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### **Deploy to Railway:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the zephix-backend directory
cd zephix-backend

# Verify build compatibility
npm run verify:railway

# Deploy (Railway will use the corrected configuration)
railway up
```

### **Monitor Deployment:**
```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Check service health
railway open
```

---

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Build Still Fails:**
1. **Check Railway logs** for build output verification
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check Node.js version** compatibility (v20)
4. **Ensure all dependencies** are properly installed

### **Common Issues:**
- **Module not found**: Verify `dist/main.js` exists after build
- **Permission denied**: Check file permissions on Railway
- **Environment variables**: Ensure all required vars are set

---

## **SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Environment Variables:**
- ‚úÖ All secrets stored in Railway environment variables
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded values in configuration files
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security headers via Helmet
- ‚úÖ CORS properly configured for production domains

### **Health Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint: `/api/health`
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity verification
- ‚úÖ Service status monitoring

---

## **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **‚úÖ Successful Deployment:**
1. Build completes without errors
2. Service starts successfully
3. Health check endpoint responds
4. Database connections established
5. All environment variables loaded

### **‚ùå Failed Deployment:**
1. Build errors in Railway logs
2. Service fails to start
3. Health check endpoint unreachable
4. Database connection failures
5. Missing environment variables

---

## **NEXT STEPS AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

1. **Verify API endpoints** are accessible
2. **Test database connections** and migrations
3. **Monitor application logs** for any runtime issues
4. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
5. **Configure custom domain** if needed

---

## **SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE**

### **Regular Maintenance:**
- Monitor Railway usage and costs
- Update dependencies regularly
- Review and rotate secrets
- Monitor application performance

### **Emergency Procedures:**
- **Service down**: Check Railway status and logs
- **Build failures**: Verify configuration files
- **Database issues**: Check connection strings and migrations

---

**üöÄ Your Railway deployment is now configured correctly and should work without the path issue!**
